RFM Rule-Based Segmentation Report

üìä Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation through a rule-based approach. The entire process was implemented in Excel, utilizing built-in functions, pivot tables, and manual scoring techniques. The aim is to identify patterns in customer behavior and strategically segment the customer base for actionable marketing.

üìì Process Summary

Step 1: Data Cleaning & Structuring

Sorted Customer IDs in ascending order to detect and align patterns.

Created essential columns:

Revenue: Total spend per transaction.

Day Difference (DayDiff): Represents tenure/recency based on days between visits.

Frequency: Number of purchases made by a customer.

Used Remove Duplicates to clean repeated invoice records.

Applied PivotTables to aggregate:

Revenue per Customer

Count of unique Invoice Numbers (Frequency)




Step 2: Frequency & Revenue Calculation

Frequency: Count of unique invoices using PivotTable.

Revenue: Sum of spending for each customer.



Step 3: Basket Size Calculation

Formula:

Basket Size = Total Revenue (Monetary) / Frequency

Indicates the average spend per shopping visit.



Step 4: Visit Interval Calculation

Formula:

(Last Visit Date - First Visit Date) / (Frequency - 1)

Used to measure how often the customer visits (e.g., every 52 days).



Step 5: RFM Scoring & Categorization

Manually binned Recency and Frequency scores into 5 equal groups (quintiles).

Assigned R and F scores (1 = worst, 5 = best).

Concatenated scores into a composite segment ID (e.g., F4R2).




Step 6: Segment Labeling

Using R-F score combinations, segments were defined as:

Champions: High F, Low R (recent and frequent buyers)

Loyal Customers: Mid F, Mid R (consistent but not very recent)

Hibernating: Low F, High R (long gone or churned customers)




üìÇ Excel File Operations Summary

File Used: Copy of Miuul_Retail_RFM_HamV01.xlsx

Key operations performed in the Excel file:

Data Preparation

Filtered blank records and computed TotalPrice using:

= Quantity * Price

Revenue Calculation

Used PivotTable to sum TotalPrice per Customer ID.

Frequency Calculation

Counted unique Invoice values per Customer ID.

Recency Calculation

Used MAX(InvoiceDate) to compute difference:

= MAX(InvoiceDate) - InvoiceDate

Visit Interval

Formula:

= (LastDate - FirstDate) / (Frequency - 1)

Basket Size

Formula:

= Monetary / Frequency

RFM Scoring

Recency and Frequency values divided into 5 bins manually.

Scores assigned based on ranking (e.g., 1 to 5).

Segment Analysis

Segments visualized using PivotTables.

Count and percentage per segment calculated.

üîÑ Frequency Examples & Basket Size Explained

üîÑ 1. Customer-Based Frequency (RFM's "F")

Definition: Total number of purchases made by a customer.

Example:

Customer ID

Invoice No

101

A0001

101

A0002

102

A0003

101

A0004

Customer 101 ‚Üí 3 purchases ‚Üí Frequency = 3

Customer 102 ‚Üí 1 purchase ‚Üí Frequency = 1

Excel Formula:

=COUNTIF(A:A, A2)

üçé 2. Product-Based Frequency (Market Basket Analysis)

Definition: How many different baskets contain a specific product.

Example:

Basket ID

Product

B001

Apple

B001

Banana

B002

Apple

B003

Banana

B003

Apple

Apple appears in 3 different baskets ‚Üí Frequency = 3

Banana appears in 2 different baskets ‚Üí Frequency = 2

Excel Formula (advanced):

=SUM(--(FREQUENCY(IF(B2:B100="Apple", MATCH(A2:A100,A2:A100,0)), ROW(A2:A100)-ROW(A2)+1)>0))

Or use a PivotTable with:

Rows: Product

Values: Distinct Count of Basket ID

üîπ Basket Size

Definition: Average amount spent per transaction by a customer.

Formula:

Basket Size = Monetary / Frequency

Example:

Customer ID

Total Spend

Frequency

101

1500 TL

3

102

900 TL

2

Customer 101 ‚Üí Basket Size = 1500 / 3 = 500 TL

Customer 102 ‚Üí Basket Size = 900 / 2 = 450 TL

‚è±Ô∏è Visit Interval (How Often Customers Shop)

Definition: Average days between a customer's purchases.

Example Data:

Customer ID

Invoice Date

101

01.01.2024

101

05.01.2024

101

10.01.2024

101

20.01.2024

Step 1: Subtract dates

=B3 - B2

Step 2: Calculate average

=AVERAGE(C2:C4)

Alternative formula:

=(LastDate - FirstDate) / (Frequency - 1)

Example: (20 - 1) / (4 - 1) = 19 / 3 = 6.33 days
